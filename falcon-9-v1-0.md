# Hardware
The Falcon 9 v1.0 variant is the only Falcon 9 variant to use the tic-tac-toe engine layout. This was replaced in the Falcon 9 v1.1 with the "octaweb", which was superior from mass, reliability, and ease of access standpoints.

## Engines
The first stage contains 9 [Merlin 1C](merlin-1c) engines, and the upper stage contains a single [Merlin 1C vacuum](merlin-1c#vacuum-variant) engine.
